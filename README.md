### Pyqueex 0.7

Clone of an ancient arcade game in Pygame - not complete yet.

Version 0.7 - Complete rewrite.

License: GNU GPL, version 3.

Version 0.5: Main opponent, siderunners (as I call them), collision checks, display of remaining lives and percentage of filled area. So most elements are there, but there are still things to do, and some, that need fixing.
